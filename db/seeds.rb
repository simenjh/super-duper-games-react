It tells the story of how Rayman stops Andr√©, an evil black lum, from taking over the world with his army of sack-like 'Hoodlum' soldiers. Unlike the game's predecessor, Rayman 3 took a more light-hearted turn, it has sarcastic self-referential undertones and pokes fun at the platforming video game genre. It was released for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows by Ubi Soft in 2003 and OS X by Feral Interactive in 2004."

Set in fictional Hick County, the game revolves around completing trips between cities, delivering goods, and competing in races while at the helm of an eighteen wheeler. The game is available on GameCube, Xbox, PlayStation 2, and PC. It met with middling critical and commercial reception, due to repetitive gameplay, dated graphics, and lackluster sound. The game uses Steppenwolf's 'Born to Be Wild' as its theme song. The sequel is Big Mutha Truckers 2. A different game of the same name was developed by Italian company Raylight Studios and released for the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS."
